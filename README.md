## Neighbourhood Map portfolio project

In project #5 of udacity's Frontend Nanodegree the task was to make a single page application
showing different locations on Google maps. I choose to display twenty five random restaurants in New York,New York.

### Libraries, frameworks and APIs used

* Knockout JS
* Jquery
* Google Maps APIs
* locu API
* Pure css framework

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/WarrenAdams/Neighbourhood-Map

  ```

1. Run a local server for the project in the dist folder.

  ```bash
  $> cd /Neighbourhood-Map
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080

#### Project Requirements and Features

* Knockout must be used to handle the list, filter, and any other information on the page that is subject to changing state.

* Asynchrony and Error Handling.All data APIs used in the project should load asynchronously and errors should be handled gracefully.

* Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.

* Write code required to display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within this neighborhood.

* Implement a list view of the set of locations.

* Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load.

* Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked

* Add functionality to open an infoWindow and to animate a map marker when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.
